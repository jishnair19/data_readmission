A hospital readmission is an episode of care that occurs when a patient who had been discharged from a hospital is admitted again
within a specified time interval. Readmission rates have been increasingly used as an outcom emeasures in health services research
and as a quality benchmark for health systems. The goal of the project was to see if we can predict future hospital readmissions
before they occur leveraging data gathered at the index admission discharge. These predictions can be used by care team to proactively 
engage with at risk to try an dprevent the future readmission.  Resources can be distributed properly based on the risk level of each individual patient to reduce inefficient spend.
